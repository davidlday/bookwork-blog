It's good to have goals, right? Here's what I hope to achieve in the near term:

* Host a master index website of contemporary short fiction freely available on the web
  * Initially target pro and semi-pro markets in SF/F/H
  * New writers can use this as a starting point to research target markets
  * Readers can use this to keep tabs on new free fiction from pro and semi-pro markets
  * I will use this to develop fingerprints of genre and markets
* Expand the master index to include:
  * Pro and semi-pro markets in other genres
  * Works not available for free but which are available for purchase on the web
    * This will rely on contributed texts from editors and writers
    * Remember, this is an index only - none of the content will be available on bookworm
  * I will continue to use this to analyze genre and markets
* Provide free access to collected metrics
  * Registration required, but no fees
  * Create a terms of service to protect the rights of writers and editors
