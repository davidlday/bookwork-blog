## What's the deal?

I originally posted a little something on Tubmlr about [why book review suck](http://tumblr.davidlday.com/post/30579650629/why-book-reviews-suck-and-how-we-can-fix-them). I don't really think book reviews suck, but I think there's an opportunity to more quickly and effectively connect readers with fiction they'll enjoy.

Here's what I believe:

* Fiction is art
* Art is subjective
* Technology has greatly increased the amount of noise in the fiction industry
  * Writing a piece of fiction requires little to no investment
  * Submitting work for consideration also requires little to no investment
  * Agents and editors are inundated with submissions, most of which are the written equivalent to a marketing cold call (see: [Slush Pile Hell](http://slushpilehell.tumblr.com/))
  * Self-Publishing has taken hold, and while there is quality fiction coming out of self-published authors, the trend has also increased the amount of noise in the market place
* The technology exists to create filters that can reduce this noise on the receiving side (agents, editors, readers)
* Since fiction is art, and art is subjective, these filters must take into account the measurable preferences of the reader
* It's easier to quantify what isn't art than it is to quantify what is art
* Technology can't render a verdict on a work's value, but it can prioritize the order in which a reader will consider a list of works (something like Google's [Priority Inbox](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/186531?hl=en))

It's about creating a recommendation engine that's based on the individual, not on crowds. Sites like Amazon, Goodreads ([also Amazon](http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/retailing/article/56575-amazon-buys-goodreads.html)), Shelfari ([also Amazon](http://techcrunch.com/2008/08/25/amazon-aquires-shelfari-moves-to-corner-social-book-space/)), and all the other booksellers that have recommendation engines on their site derive recommendations by comparing what you've read to what other people have read. No one is analyzing the actual text, or if they are, they're not talking about it.
