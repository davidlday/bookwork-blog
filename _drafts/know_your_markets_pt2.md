Read Part 1 if you haven't already. It give an overview of the magazines analyzed as a whole. This post provides a breakdown and looks to see if there are differences between them. And there are.


## Readability Smackdown

I picked the Coleman Liau Index for the breakdown, but I believe all of the readability measures show the same thing. What I'm looking for are peaks, specifically the central peak, and the spread to get an idea of readability level preference. BCS, Clarkesworld, Lightspeed, Nightmare, and Tor all have similar peaks, around 7.75. Daily Science Fiction and Strange Horizons are noticeably lower at around 6.5. Those values in and of themselves arenâ€™t a measure of good or bad. To me this means overall DSF and Strange Horizons prefer less complex writing than the others.

I also noticed that BCS, Lightspeed, and Nightmare are higher and tighter (peaks reaching around 11% of stories) while Clarkesworld, DSF, Strange Horizons, and Tor are a little lower and wider (peaks around 7%), which makes me think the preference is stronger or more consistent in BCS, Lightspeed, and Nightmare.


# We all have the same Point of View

This was pretty consistent across all of the magazines. Clear preference for third person, covering nearly 65% of all stories, and a clear preference against second person at less than 5% of all stories. I don't think this would surprise anyone.


# Dialogue

All magazines seem to prefer 25% or less dialogue. BCS has a clearly defined peak in the 15-20% range, and DSF has a clear peak in the 0-5% range. Interestingly enough, DSF seems to have a clear preference for little or no dialogue, but is also the only magazines that has published stories with 100% dialogue.

Nightmare's preference seems to lie between 0-15%, with nearly 75% of all stories falling in this range. Lightspeed is spread out a little more evenly between 0-25%, as do both Tor and Strange Horizons. Clarkesworld is a little tighter, with most stories pretty evenly between 0-20%.


Average Words per Sentence:

BCS, Lightspeed, Nightmare, and Tor all peak roughly around 16, and range between 10-24. DSF and Strange Horizons peak around 10, and spread 6-18. Clarkesworld doesn't really have a clear peak, but appears evenly spread between 8-18. DSF and Strange Horizons seem to prefer shorter sentences overall.


Average Syllables per Word:

Usually used to gauge word complexity. There doesn't really seem to be any clear distinction between the magazines here. All fall in the 1.2 to 1.5 range. I'm still thinking this one over. Not sure an average does it justice.
