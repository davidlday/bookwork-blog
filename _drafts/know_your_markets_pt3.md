What else can we measure:

* Are there words only found in stories that are accepted or stories that are rejected?
* Sentences per paragraph?
* Sections? Probably meaningless.
* Parts of speech - adjectives, adverbs, nouns, etc.

What's wrong with this:

* It only accounts for survivors. Talk about survivorship bias.
