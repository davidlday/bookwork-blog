* What does "Know Your Markets" mean to a SF/F/H writer?
* Craft vs. Art.
* Reading everything in the market is challenging, but necessary to understand art, because art is difficult to measure.
* Craft, however, is measurable.
** spelling and grammar are basics, but very fundemental
** other metrics exist by which to measure craft (list some here)
* Can a writer learn anything by using text analytics on the markets?

Yes.

* Summary of the study. Market size, how I choose markets.
** Emphasize that each data point represents a pro sale.
** No value judgement on any of the stories. All are equal.

I analyzed roughly 3,000 stories from the following markets, all publicly available on their websites at the time of analysis (December 2014). These magazines represent, for the most part, a good set of professional short story markets in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror.


# Readability

Readability is typically used to measure the complexity of a document. There are several measures, most of which try to align to a U.S. grade level. You can find a list of links to the various measure represented here on the [Measuring Fiction](/metrics/) page.

For my purpose, I'm not particularly interested in grade level. Nor do I believe that the measure provide any value judgement in this context. A story with a [Coleman-Liau Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman-Liau_Index) of 7 is neither better nor worse than one with an index of 4. It simply means the language is a little more complex. Hemingway used simple language to great effect.

What I do believe, however, is that the readership of these magazines have preferences, and those preferences include a tolerance for a range of complexity. And all five of the readability measures demonstrate that this preference exists. Overall, we see a nice peak in all five graphs. For instance, the Coleman-Liau histogram shows that the bulk of stories analyzed fall between 5 and 9, meaning if you story isn't in this range, then statistically speaking you're less likely to make a pro sale to any of these magazines.

## Point of View

Point of view was an interesting problem. Basically I stripped out all the dialogue then counted POV indicators (First: I, we; Second: you; Third: he, she, it, they). Whichever had the most won. It's a rough estimate, but in my sample checking I found it to be basically accurate.

There's a clear preference overall for stories told in the third person POV, nearly double that of first person, and a very low number of stories told in second. Second person can be used effectively, and if you look at the underlying data you can find links to the stories analyzed. But you're chances of selling a story written in third person are higher.


## Amount of Dialogue

This was an interesting byproduct of trying to figure out POV. I was able to see how much of a story was spent in dialogue, dialogue being anything between double quotes. Again, not 100% accurate, and

# Comparisons

## Readability

https://public.tableausoftware.com/views/Bookworm-SFFHProShortStoryMarketAnalyisis/ReadabilityComparison?:embed=y&:display_count=no

I picked the Coleman Liau Index for the breakdown, but I believe all of the readability measures show the same thing. What I'm looking for are peaks, specifically the central peak, and the spread to get an idea of readability level preference. BCS, Clarkesworld, Lightspeed, Nightmare, and Tor all have similar peaks, around 7.75. Daily Science Fiction and Strange Horizons are noticeably lower at around 6.5. Those values in and of themselves aren’t a measure of good or bad. To me this means overall DSF and Strange Horizons prefer less complex writing than the others.

I also noticed that BCS, Lightspeed, and Nightmare are higher and tighter (peaks reaching around 11% of stories) while Clarkesworld, DSF, Strange Horizons, and Tor are a little lower and wider (peaks around 7%), which makes me think the preference is stronger or more consistent in BCS, Lightspeed, and Nightmare.


Point of View:

https://public.tableausoftware.com/views/Bookworm-SFFHProShortStoryMarketAnalyisis/POVComparison?:embed=y&:display_count=no

This was pretty consistent across all of the magazines. Clear preference for third person, covering nearly 65% of all stories, and a clear preference against second person at less than 5% of all stories. I don't think this would surprise anyone.


Percent Dialogue:

https://public.tableausoftware.com/views/Bookworm-SFFHProShortStoryMarketAnalyisis/DialogueComparison?:embed=y&:display_count=no

All magazines seem to prefer 25% or less dialogue. BCS has a clearly defined peak in the 15-20% range, and DSF has a clear peak in the 0-5% range. Interestingly enough, DSF seems to have a clear preference for little or no dialogue, but is also the only magazines that has published stories with 100% dialogue.

Nightmare's preference seems to lie between 0-15%, with nearly 75% of all stories falling in this range. Lightspeed is spread out a little more evenly between 0-25%, as do both Tor and Strange Horizons. Clarkesworld is a little tighter, with most stories pretty evenly between 0-20%.


Average Words per Sentence:

https://public.tableausoftware.com/views/Bookworm-SFFHProShortStoryMarketAnalyisis/WordsSentenceComparison?:embed=y&:display_count=no

BCS, Lightspeed, Nightmare, and Tor all peak roughly around 16, and range between 10-24. DSF and Strange Horizons peak around 10, and spread 6-18. Clarkesworld doesn't really have a clear peak, but appears evenly spread between 8-18. DSF and Strange Horizons seem to prefer shorter sentences overall.


Average Syllables per Word:

https://public.tableausoftware.com/views/Bookworm-SFFHProShortStoryMarketAnalyisis/SyllablesWordComparison?:embed=y&:display_count=no

Usually used to gauge word complexity. There doesn't really seem to be any clear distinction between the magazines here. All fall in the 1.2 to 1.5 range. I'm still thinking this one over. Not sure an average does it justice.
