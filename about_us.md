## Who's involved?

It's a short list.

* [David L. Day](http://www.davidlday.com) - I have roughly four jobs:
  * Husband to a wonderful woman
  * Father to two energetic boys
  * Writer (see my [main site](http://www.davidlday.com) for more info)
  * Technology architect at a major insurance company

My day job is as the database and business intelligence technology area leader. You can visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dday376) to find out a little more about my technology work, although I haven't updated it since taking the technology architect role.

I've had a lot of offline conversations over the past two years with folks in both the technology and publishing industry to learn more about possibilities, needs, and interests.
