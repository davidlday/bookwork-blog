# What I promise:

* Obey all robots.txt rules and any rules embedded in \<meta\> tags
* Keep a level playing field and ensure all participants are treated equally
* Minimize use of resources on analyzed sites
* Every site crawled may opt out at any time

# What I think, but can't promise yet:

* Every site crawled will be asked permission before being crawled
