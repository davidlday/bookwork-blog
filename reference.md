Thoughts on how fiction can be measured. Maybe they don't all apply, and maybe not in all situations, but it's starting point.

* The Basics
  * Syllable Count
  * Word Count
  * Sentence Count
  * Paragraph Count
* Specific to Fiction
  * Dialog Word / Syllable Count
  * Narrative Word / Syllable Count
* Readability Tests (in no particular order)
