I've added a few new interesting things to the site.

First, I've created a [Statistics]({{site.baseurl}}statistics/) page that reflects stats of all the stories I've indexed in real time. The charts aren't quite as pretty as the ones I made with Tableau in my initial posts, but they're functional and update automatically as I continue researching and indexing.

I've also put up an [Analyzer]({{site.baseurl}}analyze/) page that'll analyze a piece of text using the same algorithms I used and return results. Not terribly useful right now, because it's the same as all the other Readability tools out there. However, I plan to marry this up with the statistics to let me compare a piece of text to those of a specific magazine. This, to me, is much more meaningful as the published stories provide the context which gives meaning to the results.

[Story Search]({{site.baseurl}}storysearch/) is probably the most useful piece so far. Interested in how many published stories in the magazines analyzed are about [zombies]({{site.baseurl}}storysearch/?q=zombie)? Oh, and not only does it search, but for each story in the result set I provide 5 similar stories (and no, they're not always stories in the original search results). Pretty interesting way to research contemporary fiction, eh?

I've been thinking a lot about this "Similar Stories" feature, and how we (writers, editors, publishers) could use it for cross-selling and hands-free marketing. My thoughts aren't quite solid enough to share, but in the next couple of months I'll plan to post more on the idea.

In the meantime, have fun!
